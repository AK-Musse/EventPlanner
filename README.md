# Event Management

## Background 
This application is a event planning app that people can use for scheduling for their upcoming events and appointments. This CRUD application was developed using RESTful architecture principles and MERN stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS. React v6.0, & Node.js)

## Application Details 
Upon starting the application, they will be in the login page of the site a user can login in if they have an account or click the `Sign up` navigation button to create an account.
If you want to create a new event you can click the `Create` button on the navigation bar. Once clicked you will be in a new page where you will be adding the name of the event name, description, type, and date. After that you click on `Submit` button. You will then be redirected to the events list view where your new event is saved at.

Once a user has event/s in the table they can check the details about that event by clicking on the event name. Also in the event details page you can see the details . Also there is an `Update` button once clicked will be redirected to the update form where information of that event is preloaded into the input text boxes which a user can now change or delete. Once the changes have been made the user then hits the `Update` button and will be redirected back to the detials page.
